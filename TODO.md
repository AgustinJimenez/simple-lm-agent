## Technical Challenges

### High Priority Issues

1. **Candle-RS API Compatibility** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Current Candle-RS API has changed significantly
   - GGUF loading requires complex tensor manipulation
   - Missing proper documentation for GGUF integration
   - Need to research current Candle-RS examples and patterns

2. **Model Configuration Extraction** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - GGUF metadata parsing is complex
   - Different models have different configuration structures
   - Need robust fallback values for missing metadata

3. **Memory Management** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Large models require careful memory handling
   - Need to implement proper model unloading
   - Consider model quantization for memory efficiency

### Medium Priority Issues

4. **Tokenizer Compatibility**
   - Different models use different tokenizer formats
   - Need robust tokenizer detection and fallback

5. **Error Handling**
   - Better error messages for model loading failures
   - Graceful degradation when models fail to load
   - User-friendly error reporting

6. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize model loading times
   - Implement caching for repeated operations
   - Consider async model loading with progress updates

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Model Integration (Current Focus)
- [ ] Fix Candle-RS compilation issues
- [ ] Implement basic GGUF model loading
- [ ] Get simple text generation working
- [ ] Replace mock responses with actual model inference

### Phase 2: Stability and User Experience
- [ ] Improve error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Add model loading progress indicators
- [ ] Implement proper conversation context management
- [ ] Add basic generation parameter controls

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] GPU acceleration support
- [ ] Advanced sampling methods
- [ ] Model switching capability
- [ ] Conversation management features

### Phase 4: Polish and Distribution
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
- [ ] Documentation and examples
- [ ] Release packaging

## Technical Notes

### Current Dependencies
```toml
# Core Tauri and async
tauri = "2"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
anyhow = "1.0"

# ML and model loading
candle-core = "0.8"
candle-nn = "0.8"
candle-transformers = "0.8"
tokenizers = "0.20"
bytemuck = "1.0"
half = "2.0"

# Utilities
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
dotenvy = "0.15"
```

### Known Working Alternatives
If Candle-RS integration proves too complex, consider these alternatives:
1. **llama-cpp-rs** - Requires libclang but more stable
2. **mistral.rs** - Higher-level Candle wrapper
3. **External process** - Run llama.cpp as subprocess
4. **Server mode** - Connect to Ollama/LM Studio

### File Structure
```
src-tauri/src/lib.rs        # Main agent logic (needs GGUF integration)
src/App.tsx                 # Frontend chat interface (complete)
.env                        # Model configuration (functional)
Cargo.toml                  # Dependencies (needs fixing)
```

## How to Contribute

### For GGUF Integration
1. Research current Candle-RS GGUF examples
2. Fix API compatibility issues in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
3. Test with actual GGUF models
4. Improve error handling

### For UI/UX
1. Enhance chat interface design
2. Add loading states and progress indicators
3. Improve responsive design
4. Add accessibility features

### For Testing
1. Test with different GGUF models
2. Test on different platforms
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Memory usage optimization

## Quick Start for Developers

1. **Get a GGUF model**: Download from Hugging Face or use LM Studio
2. **Set up environment**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set MODEL_PATH
3. **Current state**: Run `npm run tauri dev` to see working chat interface
4. **Focus area**: Fix GGUF loading in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`

## Contact and Discussion

- **Primary issue**: Candle-RS GGUF integration complexity
- **Immediate need**: Working model inference to replace mock responses
- **Long-term goal**: Full-featured local GGUF model chat application

**Note**: This TODO file reflects the current development status. The application works as a chat interface with intelligent mock responses, but actual GGUF model inference requires significant additional development work.
