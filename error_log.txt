Error: Failed to initialize model: 
The test.rs example uses APIs that don't exist in candle 0.8: 
- Config::from_gguf() doesn't exist 
- gguf.var_builder() doesn't exist 
- model.empty_cache() doesn't exist 
- SafeTensors::load() is private The test.rs appears to be written for a different candle version. 
To implement real inference, we need to: 
1. Find the correct candle version for test.rs, OR 
2. Research candle 0.8 APIs and rewrite the model loading Your model file is validated and ready 
- we just need compatible APIs.
